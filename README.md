# Arduino-Car-Obstacle-Avoidance<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/022Fl.gif" width="100">

This project is designed to create an obstacle avoidance system for an Arduino car with four motors and four wheels. The car is equipped with a TSOP sensor for remote control, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and an optional servo motor for additional functionality. The project requires the use of Arduino IDE and Microchip Studio software.

### Usage
<p>
📌 Turn on the power supply to the Arduino Uno and H-bridge motor driver module. <br>
📌 Use the TSOP sensor or the remote control to send commands to the Arduino car for controlling its movements. <br>
📌 The ultrasonic sensor will detect obstacles in the car's path. <br>
📌 If an obstacle is detected, the Arduino car will adjust its direction to avoid the obstacle & the buzzer will make sound. <br>
📌 The optional servo motor can be used for additional functionality. </p>
